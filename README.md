This package tries to provide an easy interface to fetch the artist, title, and lyrics given a link. Currently this package supports 3 major lyrics providers:

1. [AZLyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/)
2. [MetroLyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/)
3. [MojimLyrics](http://mojim.com/)

## Motivation

The motivation behind this package mainly is for another project of mine [Split Lyrics](https://split-lyrics.ycmjason.com/) which split the lyrics into half and display them on the screen so that we won't need to scroll while singing/player guitar.
